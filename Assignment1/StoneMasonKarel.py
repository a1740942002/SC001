At present, the StoneMasonKarel file does nothing.
Your job in the assignment is to add the necessary code to
instruct Karel to build a column (a vertical structure
that is 5 beepers tall) in each avenue that is either on the right
or left side of the arch, as described in the Assignment 1 handout. 
Karel should end on the last avenue, 1st Street, facing east.
